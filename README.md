# Flashcard Popup - Chrome Extension
Simple Chrome extension that takes Quizlet URL, parses the flashcards into a JSON file, and send to the front end. Front end will store decks of flashcards in Chrome's local storage and pull a card randomly in a selected deck for users to review.

The goal is to make reviewing easier without allocating a separate session. Users will be asked to provide answers to flashcards in the deck that they choose periodically when they're using Chrome.
